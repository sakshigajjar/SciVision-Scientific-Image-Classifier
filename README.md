# Scientific-Image-Classifier
This repository contains the codebase for our team's project developed during the MINED Hackathon'24. Our project focuses on building a scientific image classifier using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

# Features
+ Deep Learning Models: We utilize advanced deep learning models such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.

+ Customizable: Our codebase is designed to be easily customizable, allowing users to train the model on their own datasets or fine-tune the existing model for specific tasks.

+ Prediction and Visualization: We provide functions for predicting classes of input images and visualizing the prediction results, making it easier to understand and interpret the model's outputs.

# Getting Started
To get started with using our scientific image classifier:

Step-1: Clone this repository to your local machine/Kaggle. <br>
Step-2: Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install if you encounter any error in importing. <br>
Step-3: If you want to train the model on our dataset or new dataset, run the training code. If you want to test on new images download the model from this repo and load the model and predict! (only .jpg files will be supported, .png is not supported right now) <br>
